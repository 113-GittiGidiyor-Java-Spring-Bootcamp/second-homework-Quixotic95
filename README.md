# Known Bugs

* While you sending a **DELETE REQUEST** with an **OBJECT** which has a **modified ID**, it deletes the **OBJECT that has the modified ID** instead of the **OBJECT itself**. *(An authorization problem due to business login more than a bug.)*
* You can't delete an instructor if he/she is **instructing a course**. *(Business logic more than a bug. / Probably could be changed with cascade types.)*
